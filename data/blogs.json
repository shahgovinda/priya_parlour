    "excerpt": "<p>Life is all about balance. <em>Sweatpants</em> on the bottom and great hair on top, a healthy meal and a sweet treat after, or a sweaty home workout sesh followed by a lazy day, it’s all about finding the right balance to help maintain a sense of normalcy this holiday season. That goes for holiday looks too—this holiday season, the theme is cute but comfy, finding looks to carry you all the way through from movie-marathons to spontaneous holiday Zoom parties.</p><p>This year’s holidays look a little (read: a lot different). While it has been a year of ups and downs and unpredictability, if you’re like us, you’ve been through every mood in the book. There may not be large holiday parties to get glammed up for, but you <em>can</em> still play with your look to suit your different moods this holi-stay season.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. When you feel like dressing up on the couch</h2><p>Sport to dress up and go to the only place we want to go this holiday season—the couch. Whether you are hitting the couch for a wine-filled holiday Zoom hang, a holiday movie marathon, or for some R&amp;R after a day of baking cookies, your soft&nbsp;waves will have you feeling fun, flirty, and fierce.&nbsp;</p><p>We love iconic blogger Sasha Exeter's loose waves with a classic middle part and&nbsp;Olivia's&nbsp;crochet&nbsp;headband to tie&nbsp;the look together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Use&nbsp;the to achieve any&nbsp;the perfect loose wave.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. When you’re over it</h2><p>Nothing says “over it but loving it” quite like piling all of your hair on the top of your head in a massive bun.</p><p>What do you do when you reach the point where you’re just over it all? Throw your hair up in a bun.  can be as sleek, chic, or messy — as low or high maintenance as you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Throwing your hair up in a bun is the perfect solution for when you have second-day hair or your locks just aren’t doing what you want them to do. Truthfully buns are the ideal #wfh or #hfh (holiday from home) look because they help you keep your hair out of your face and require minimal time and effort.</p><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Elevate your bun with a hair accessory like a, or.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. When you're feeling the love</h2><h3>Romantic updo with side braid</h3><p>Did your significant other just surprise you with the news that they are bringing home fancy takeout or ingredients for a delicious home cooked meal? Sounds like you have a date night you didn’t quite prepare for. The good thing is that, with an updo, you can worry less about your hair and spend more time looking forward to the spontaneous treat.</p><p>Updos are pretty and elegant, but they can also be casual or edgy—it all depends how you accessorize and complete the look. The best part about  is that they look great and can be done in no time at all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Add a braid down the side&nbsp;or&nbsp;finish off the look with a sultry hair accessory for late night fun with your SO.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>4.&nbsp;When you just want to watch The Grinch in Christmas pajamas</h2><p>Is there anything better than snuggling up on the couch with a cozy blanket while the snow falls silently outside? We didn't think so.&nbsp;Nothing says Christmas spirit quite&nbsp;,  and candy canes—complete with a couple of cute pigtails, of course.&nbsp;</p><p>We love the look of these long sleek pigtails, using two clip-in to add instant length volume.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Elevate your pigtails by styling the two pieces; braid them, add different sections...get creative! </p>"
